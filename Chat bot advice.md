## I'm writing an app for the legal medical marijuana industry called Medical Card. What are some useful features for this app?

 Some potential features that could be useful for an app for the legal medical marijuana industry include:

* A directory of licensed dispensaries and medical marijuana providers, including their locations, hours of operation, and menus of available products.
* A system for verifying and renewing medical marijuana prescriptions, including the ability for users to upload and manage their prescription documents.
* A system for ordering and purchasing medical marijuana products, including the ability to select products, view prices, and complete transactions securely.
* A system for tracking and managing medical marijuana usage, including the ability to set usage goals and reminders, view consumption history, and monitor the effects of different products.
* A community forum or social networking platform where users can connect with each other, share information and experiences, and ask questions about medical marijuana use.
Educational resources and information about the legal and medical aspects of medical marijuana, including the potential benefits and risks of different products, the laws and regulations governing their use, and the latest research on their effects.

# what would a good minimally viable product for this app look like?

* A minimally viable product (MVP) for an app for the legal medical marijuana industry could include the following core features:

* A directory of licensed dispensaries and medical marijuana providers, including their locations, hours of operation, and menus of available products.
* A system for verifying and renewing medical marijuana prescriptions, including the ability for users to upload and manage their prescription documents.
* A system for ordering and purchasing medical marijuana products, including the ability to select products, view prices, and complete transactions securely.

These core features would allow users to find and purchase medical marijuana products, while also ensuring that they are doing so legally and with the appropriate prescriptions. Additionally, the MVP could include some basic educational resources and information about medical marijuana, such as the potential benefits and risks of different products, to help users make informed decisions.

By focusing on these core features, the MVP would provide a basic but functional app that could be used by medical marijuana patients and providers, while also serving as a foundation for future development and expansion.
